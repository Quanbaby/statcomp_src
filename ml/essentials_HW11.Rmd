# Use of `caret` with various methods

Run three machine learning models over the following training dataset
with features `x` and labels `y`. You can use default tuning, e.g.
bootstrap based resampling for tuning, as set by `trainControl`.

* SVM with radial kernel `"svmRadial"`
* Random forest `"rf"`
* Gradient boosting machine `"gbm"` (use `verbose=FALSE`)

Record the time to train, and the best Kappa value for each method
over the tuning grid (`rf` does not use tuning parameters via
`train` for this dataset). Which method obtains the best Kappa?

Finally, make a `pointrange` plot (see `geom_pointrange`), with the
optimal Kappa and the SD for the optimal Kappa. Is there a clear
winner, or all the methods mostly overlapping?

```{r}
data(faithful)
n <- nrow(faithful)
faithful <- data.frame(lapply(faithful, scale))
plot(faithful)
faithful$cl <- factor(kmeans(faithful, centers=2)$cluster)
plot(faithful[,1:2], col=faithful$cl)
# make it more challenging
set.seed(1)
faithful[,1] <- faithful[,1] + rt(n,df=5)/2
faithful[,2] <- faithful[,2] + rt(n,df=5)/2
plot(faithful[,1:2], col=faithful$cl)
x <- faithful[,1:2]
y <- faithful[,3]
```
